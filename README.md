A Quizzing platform aimed at gamifying learning and making the process more fun for students

## Philosophy
* The education system so far is based on standardized tests for students of all calibers, however, we see that students of different levels of intelligence should receive questions appropriate for their level. For example, a student who is academically weak should receive eazy questions, whereas brilliant students should recieve difficult questions.
* XQuizIt aims to gamify learning, where we inspire students to go from one level to another. We assign graded quizzes so that students receive questions personalized to their performance.
* Weaker students receive easy questions, if they perform well, they level up and move up the chain and start to receive harder questions. This way, we incentivize students to learn and improve! Students improve in performance and the number of teachers needed to manage the quizzes also decreases, thus saving time and money.

* Students can view their profile which shows their total score average over the past few quizzes attended and can also view their level aimed at inspiring them 
to improve to next level.
* Students can enter the quiz code given to them by their teacher and receive a personalized quiz catered to their level of intelligence.
* Once done, students can submit the quiz and receive feedback such as their score for the current test, how much they've improved or dropped from their previous performance and key topics to focus on to perform better next time.
